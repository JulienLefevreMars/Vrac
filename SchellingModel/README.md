# Schelling's model

Variation around the [Schelling's model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schelling%27s_model_of_segregation), as described in Pablo Jensen "Deep Earnings"
Agents of two types are located on a N x N grid. They want to be in a mixed environment. Each agent is randomly chosen and if its satisfaction is better in another location of the grid it is moved. At the end, one observes segregated communities whereas segregation is not intended by the individuals !

## To run the code

`python schelling_model.py`

will run 10000 iterations

`python schelling_model.py [Niter]`

to adapat the code with another number of iterations
